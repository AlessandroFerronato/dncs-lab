# Requirements
 - Linux/MacOS operating system
 - Python 3
 - 10GB disk storage
 - 2GB free RAM
 - Virtualbox
 - Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com)
 - Internet

# How-to
 - Install Virtualbox and Vagrant
 - Clone this repository
`git clone https://github.com/dustnic/dncs-lab`
 - You should be able to launch the lab from within the cloned repo folder.
```
cd dncs-lab
[~/dncs-lab] vagrant up
```
Once you launch the vagrant script, it may take a while for the entire topology to become available.
 - Verify the status of the 4 VMs
 ```
 [dncs-lab]$ vagrant status                                                                                                                                                                
Current machine states:

router                    running (virtualbox)
switch                    running (virtualbox)
host-a                    running (virtualbox)
host-b                    running (virtualbox)
```
- Once all the VMs are running verify you can log into all of them:
`vagrant ssh router`
`vagrant ssh switch`
`vagrant ssh host-a`
`vagrant ssh host-b`

# Assignment
This section describes the assignment, its requirements and the tasks the student has to complete.
## Design Requirements
- Hosts 1-a and 1-b are in two subnets (*Hosts-A* and *Hosts-B*) that must be able to scale up to respectively {{ HostsASubnetRequiredAddresses }} and {{ HostsBSubnetRequiredAddresses }} usable addresses
- Host 2-c is in a subnet (*Hub*) that needs to accommodate up to {{ HubSubnetRequiredAddresses }} usable addresses
- Host 2-c must run a docker image (dustnic82/nginx-test) which implements a web-server that must be reachable from Host-1-a and Host-1-b
- No dynamic routing can be used
- Routes must be as generic as possible (i.e. if a subnet has just one router assume that is the default gateway for all traffic)
- The lab setup must be portable and executed just by launching the `vagrant up` command
## Tasks
- Fork the Github repository: https://github.com/dustnic/dncs-lab
- Clone the repository
- Run the initiator script (dncs-init)
- Document the design by expanding this readme file
- Implement the design by integrating the necessary commands into the VM startup scripts
- Fill the answers.yml file where required
- Commit the changes and push to your own repository
